# nixos
My configuration for nixos.

## Motivation
Long story short, I got a new computer and realized that my development environment was tightly coupled to my old computer (macos).
So, after some reading, I learned that I could use nix to manage my development enviroment and the dependencies that I need for various programs.
I have wanted to use GNU/Linux as my daily driver again because I can easily add functionality as needs grow.
After fighting with some preconfigured distros, discovering the utility of emacs org-babel, understanding the purpose of cmake, and many hours of debugging dependencies, I have gained deeper insights into why nix exists.
I now see it as something I would like to learn more about and use to improve my understanding of software.
Therefore, I will be experimenting with nixos with the goal to make it my primary daily driver and to learn more about dependency management.
